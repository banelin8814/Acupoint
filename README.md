Acupoint is an AR project that projects acupuncture points on the face and hands in real-time, enabling easy acupoint location and browsing.

## Features

- Utilizes ARSCNFaceGeometry (ARKit) for facial recognition, obtaining facial topology and accurately placing acupoints on a 3D face.
- Uses VNHumanHandPoseObservation (Vision) with AVFoundation for hand recognition, identifying hand posture and features, and marking acupoint locations.
- Implements SwiftData for offline storage of frequently used acupoints.
- Implements Google Sign-In and Sign in with Apple for user authentication.
- Utilizes Firebase Firestore for storing personal acupoint information.
- Utilizes Crashlytics to proactively track, analyze, and resolve app crashes and errors.
- Includes Unit Tests to verify the accuracy of the acupuncture point localization algorithm.
